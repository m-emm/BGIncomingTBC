# BGIncomingTBC
## A World of Warcraft TBC Addon for Battlegrounds

Playing in the Arathi Basin or in the Eye of the Storm, and the baddies are coming? Fumbling to type "/bg Incoming! GM! 3, no, 4!" while you are dying and stunned by a rogue?

Use BGIncoming!

Just one click, and your team members are warned! 

Supported Battlefields (only TBC):

- Arathi Basin
- Eye of the Storm

### Features

- One-click warning from incoming enemies
- Automatically determines which battleground you're entering, and switches the available locations accordingly
- Automatically switches the location (BS, GM, MT, ...) when moving around the battlefield. You can still change this manually, for example if you see that another location is being attacked.
- One-click announcement of a location being safe - once you have killed all the baddies
 
 This addon was heavily inspired by BGCallouts, but is a complete re-write - thanks to the authors of BGCallouts for the inspiration!
